# Task 1: Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Key Learnings

1. **Loading the Dataset**: 
   - Learned how to load the Titanic dataset using pandas.
   - Used `info()` and `describe()` methods to get insights into the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.

2. **Understanding Data Types**: 
   - Differentiated between various data types such as:
     - **Ordinal**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd class).
     - **Numerical**: Continuous (e.g., Age, Fare) and Discrete (e.g., SibSp, Parch).
     - **Categorical**: Gender, Embarked, etc.
   - Explored unique values in categorical columns using the `unique()` method.

3. **Target Variable vs Features**:
   - Identified the target variable (**Survived**) and distinguished it from the features.
   - Analyzed the dataset to find irrelevant columns not related to the predictive outcome and removed them from the features.

4. **Feature Analysis and Selection**:
   - Analyzed how different features are related to the target variable.
   - Discovered the importance of selecting meaningful features to increase the model accuracy.

5. **Dataset's Role in Model Accuracy**:
   - Understood how the quality and relevance of the dataset significantly affect the accuracy of a machine learning model.
