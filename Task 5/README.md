# Task 5: Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics

## About This Project

This project is part of my AI & ML internship task.
The goal is to train a model and check how well it works using evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

Heart Disease Dataset

## Tools Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn

## What I Did

1. Loaded the dataset.
2. Split the data into training data and testing data.
3. Trained a Logistic Regression model using training data.
4. Predicted results using testing data.
5. Calculated:

   * Accuracy
   * Precision
   * Recall
6. Created and explained the confusion matrix.
7. Interpreted the results.

## Output

* Trained model
* Evaluation report with metrics
* Confusion matrix

## Learning Outcome

I learned how to:

* Split data into train and test sets.
* Train a simple machine learning model.
* Evaluate model performance using metrics.
